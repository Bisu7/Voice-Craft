- **Backend**  
  Located in `Backend/`, this directory contains Python modules and services powering the application's logic. Typical components might include API routes, audio processing, or machine learning inference.

- **Frontend**  
  The `Frontend/` directory houses a web app built with JavaScript (and possibly HTML/CSS). This interacts with the backend via HTTP/WebSocket, providing an interactive user interface.

## 🚀 Features

- 🎙️ Voice capture & processing
- 🔊 Backend voice analysis and transformation
- 🧠 Possible integration with speech-to-text or TTS models
- 🌐 Real-time interactive web UI

## 📦 Prerequisites

- Python 3.x  
- Node.js (v14+ recommended) + npm or Yarn  
- Optional: `ffmpeg`, `pyaudio`, or other audio-related packages

## 🛠️ Setup Instructions

### ✅ Backend

```bash
cd Backend/
# Install Python dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Or using conda
# conda env create -f environment.yml

# Run the backend server
python app.py
Replace app.py with your actual backend entry point if different.

✅ Frontend
bash
Copy
Edit
cd Frontend/
npm install
npm start

# or using yarn
# yarn install
# yarn start
This will run the frontend server on http://localhost:3000 by default.

✅ Running Full Stack
Start the backend server: python app.py

Start the frontend app: npm start

Open your browser at http://localhost:3000 and interact with the UI

🧪 Example Usage
Open the app in the browser.

Click on Record to start capturing voice.

Click Process to send it to the backend.

Output is returned and rendered in the frontend.

⚙️ Configuration
Backend

.env or config.yaml (if used) for environment settings

Common variables: PORT, DEBUG, API_KEY, etc.

Frontend

.env file (e.g., REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:5000) for connecting to backend

🛠️ Troubleshooting
Issue	Solution
Backend won't start	Check for missing dependencies or port issues
Frontend build fails	Ensure Node.js and npm/yarn are up to date
Audio not working	Check microphone permissions or ffmpeg setup
